## Philosophy

We created these images because the desktop versions of VagrantUp boxes are sparse. During development it's useful to be able to navigate through an operating system using a GUI. The VM images should be:

* Minimal and include no bloatware
* Small in size so people can download/provision their VM quicker
* Look pretty (e.g. the Plymouth loader should be installed so that the boot screen looks good)
* Be performant

In general, the VM should be a pleasure to use.
