# Packer Documentation

This repository contains documentation partials written in Markdown. The repository is used for generating the documentation for our various [Packer repositories](https://gitlab.com/megabyte-labs/packer).

You can re-build the documentation by running the following command in one of the Packer repositories:

```
bash .start.sh
```
